# External Code Review Evaluation

I'll evaluate an external code review and independently determine what changes are actually needed.

**Purpose:** Critical evaluation of external reviews (from other developers, AI tools, automated linters, etc.)

**Approach:** I will NOT blindly accept suggestions. Instead, I'll:
1. Detect project context and available tools
2. Load relevant standards and history
3. Analyze current code independently
4. Evaluate each suggestion critically
5. Record evaluation for circular review

---

## Phase 0: Project Context

{{MODULE: ~/.claude/modules/phase-0-context.md}}

**Severity Levels:** {{MODULE: ~/.claude/modules/severity-levels.md}}

**Citation Format:** {{MODULE: ~/.claude/modules/citation-standards.md}}

**Storage:** Review log stored at `${PROJECT_TASK_DOCS_DIR}/{ISSUE_KEY}-{slug}/logs/review.md`

---

## 📋 MANDATORY: Initialize Todo List

**IMMEDIATELY after loading context, create a todo list to track evaluation progress:**

```javascript
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {content: "Load project standards", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Loading project standards"},
    {content: "Load current code state", status: "pending", activeForm: "Loading current code state"},
    {content: "Wait for external review text", status: "pending", activeForm: "Waiting for external review"},
    {content: "Parse external review and check history", status: "pending", activeForm: "Parsing external review"},
    {content: "Perform independent analysis", status: "pending", activeForm: "Performing independent analysis"},
    {content: "Generate evaluation report", status: "pending", activeForm: "Generating evaluation report"},
    {content: "Record evaluation to permanent file", status: "pending", activeForm: "Recording evaluation"},
    {content: "Apply changes if approved", status: "pending", activeForm: "Applying changes"},
    {content: "Generate final summary", status: "pending", activeForm: "Generating final summary"}
  ]
})
```

**Update todo list as you progress. Mark tasks complete immediately upon finishing.**

---

## Phase 1: Load Project Standards

{{MODULE: ~/.claude/modules/standards-loading.md}}

### Business Context

**Load context in this order:**

1. **Task documentation:** Run `~/.claude/lib/bin/gather-context` to load all task docs
2. **YouTrack (if enabled):** Use `mcp__youtrack__get_issue` for issue details
3. **Git history:** `git log --grep="$ISSUE_KEY" --format="%B" | head -50`
4. **Ask user (fallback):** Request business context if not found

**STOP - Standards loaded, ready for external review**

---

## Phase 2: Load Current Code State

### 2.1 Discover Changed Files

```bash
# Get current branch
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Determine base branch (project-specific)
if git show-ref --quiet refs/heads/develop; then
  BASE="develop"
elif git show-ref --quiet refs/heads/main; then
  BASE="main"
else
  BASE="master"
fi

# Get diff statistics
git diff $BASE --stat
git diff $BASE --name-status

# Include staged/unstaged/untracked
git status --short
```

**Output:**
```markdown
**Changed Files:**
- Modified: {count} files
- Added: {count} files
- Deleted: {count} files
- Total lines: +{added} -{removed}

**Files by type:**
- Backend: {list}
- Frontend: {list}
- Tests: {list}
- Config/Migrations: {list}
```

### 2.2 Load Technical Context

**Use project-configured MCP tools:**
```bash
# Check what MCP tools are available from project context
if [ "${PROJECT_CONTEXT.mcp_tools}" contains "laravel-boost" ]; then
  # Laravel-specific context
  mcp__laravel-boost__application-info  # Get package versions
  mcp__laravel-boost__database-schema   # Get DB structure
  mcp__laravel-boost__list-routes       # Get routes
fi

if [ "${PROJECT_CONTEXT.mcp_tools}" contains "playwright" ]; then
  # Frontend testing capability available
fi
```

**Tech stack from project:**
- Backend: `${PROJECT_CONTEXT.tech_stack.backend}`
- Frontend: `${PROJECT_CONTEXT.tech_stack.frontend}`

**STOP - Context loaded, ready for review text**

---

## Phase 3: User Pastes External Review

**Now please paste the external code review text below:**

*Waiting for you to paste the review...*

---

## Phase 4: Parse External Review

**Once review is provided:**

### 4.1 Extract Suggestions
- Parse review text
- Identify individual suggestions
- Extract file/line references
- Categorize by severity (if provided)
- Note reviewer source/tool

### 4.2 Load Previous External Review History

**Load past evaluations for THIS task (circular review):**

```bash
# Load .task-docs root from global config
TASK_DOCS_DIR="$HOME/.task-docs"  # From ~/.claude/config/global.yaml

# Find task folder
TASK_FOLDER=$(find "$TASK_DOCS_DIR" -type d -name "${ISSUE_KEY}*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -n "$TASK_FOLDER" ]; then
  REVIEW_FILE="$TASK_FOLDER/logs/review.md"

  if [ -f "$REVIEW_FILE" ]; then
    echo "✅ Found previous external review evaluations"
    cat "$REVIEW_FILE"
  else
    echo "ℹ️ No previous external review record (will create new)"
  fi
else
  echo "⚠️ Task folder not found in $TASK_DOCS_DIR"
fi
```

**Why load now:**
- ✅ User has pasted external review - we know what to compare against
- ✅ Can check for duplicate suggestions
- ✅ Can maintain consistency with past decisions
- ✅ Can reference past accept/reject reasoning
- ✅ Circular review - learn from past evaluations

### 4.3 Check for Duplicates

**Now compare new suggestions with past evaluations:**

```bash
# For each suggestion in new external review
for suggestion in "${NEW_SUGGESTIONS[@]}"; do
  # Search in previous evaluations
  grep -i "${suggestion_keyword}" "$REVIEW_FILE"
done
```

**If duplicate found:**
```markdown
**⚠️ DUPLICATE DETECTED**

This suggestion appears similar to:
- Review #{N} ({date}): {ACCEPTED/REJECTED} because {reason}

**Current options:**
1. **AUTO-SKIP** if context unchanged (reference previous decision)
2. **RE-EVALUATE** if code changed since last review
3. **FLAG** if past decision seems wrong now (circular review)

**Decision:** {explain}

**Circular Review Note:**
If we made a mistake in Review #{N}, document the learning here.
```

---

## Phase 5: Independent Analysis

For EACH suggestion from external review:

### 5.1 Verify the Issue

**Read actual code:**
```bash
# Navigate to file and read relevant sections
cat {file} | sed -n '{start},{end}p'
```

**Questions:**
- Does the issue actually exist?
- Is it accurately described?
- What's the actual impact?

### 5.2 Check Against Project Standards

**Reference loaded standards using project citation format:**

```bash
# Use project-specific citation format
ARCH_FORMAT="${PROJECT_CONTEXT.citation_format.architecture}"
STYLE_FORMAT="${PROJECT_CONTEXT.citation_format.style}"
TEST_FORMAT="${PROJECT_CONTEXT.citation_format.testing}"
```

**Check against project standards:**
- Read standard files from `PROJECT_CONTEXT.standards.files[]`
- Does this violate documented rules?
- Use project citation format for references

**Examples (varies by project):**
- Starship: `[ARCH §Backend: Controllers]`
- Alephbeis: `[ARCH: "Controllers thin; delegate to Commands"]`
- Generic: `[PSR-12]`, `[ESLint]`, etc.

### 5.3 Evaluate the Suggested Fix

**Questions:**
- Is the proposed fix correct?
- Does it align with project architecture?
- Are there better alternatives?
- Would it introduce new problems?

**If Laravel project with Boost MCP:**
```bash
# Test suggested fix with tinker
mcp__laravel-boost__tinker
{paste suggested code snippet}
# Verify it actually works
```

### 5.4 Cross-Reference with Previous Decisions

**Check for consistency:**
```markdown
**Previous External Review History:**
- {date}: Similar suggestion about {topic} - {ACCEPTED/REJECTED}
- Reasoning then: {why}

**Impact on current decision:**
- ✅ Same context → Maintain consistency
- ⚠️ Different context → Explain why decision differs
- ❌ Past decision was wrong → Document learning
```

### 5.5 Determine Priority

**Classification:**
- **CRITICAL:** Must fix before merge (correctness, security, data loss)
- **MAJOR:** Should fix before merge (substantial issues)
- **MINOR:** Nice to have (small improvements)
- **OPTIONAL:** Trivial (style preferences)
- **NOT AN ISSUE:** False positive (reject)

---

## Phase 6: Generate Evaluation Report

**Create comprehensive report:**

```markdown

---
```

**STOP - Review report before finalizing**

---

## Phase 7: Record Evaluation (MANDATORY)

**Write evaluation to permanent record:**

### 7.1 Storage Location

```bash
# Load .task-docs root from global config
TASK_DOCS_DIR="$HOME/.task-docs"  # From ~/.claude/config/global.yaml

# Find or create task folder
TASK_FOLDER=$(find "$TASK_DOCS_DIR" -type d -name "${ISSUE_KEY}*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# If not found, create with basic naming (should include slug from branch)
if [ -z "$TASK_FOLDER" ]; then
  BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
  SLUG=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed "s/^[^/]*\/${ISSUE_KEY}-//")
  TASK_FOLDER="$TASK_DOCS_DIR/${ISSUE_KEY}-${SLUG}"
  mkdir -p "$TASK_FOLDER"
fi

REVIEW_FILE="$TASK_FOLDER/logs/review.md"
```

**Storage location:**
- Always: `${TASK_DOCS_DIR}/{ISSUE_KEY}-{slug}/logs/review.md`
- Configuration: `~/.claude/config/global.yaml` (`storage.task-docs_root`)

### 7.2 Create or Append Record

**If file doesn't exist, create with header:**
```markdown
# External Review Evaluations for {ISSUE_KEY}

**Project:** {project name from git remote or directory}
**Issue Pattern:** {STAR/GH/JIRA/etc}

This file tracks all external code review evaluations for this issue.

**Purpose:**
- Historical record of review decisions
- Learning reference for circular code review
- Consistency checker for similar suggestions
- Audit trail for changes

**How to use:**
- Read before evaluating new external reviews
- Check for duplicate suggestions
- Maintain consistency with past decisions
- Learn patterns about external review quality

---

```

**Append new review section:**

```markdown
## Review #{N} - {DATE} {TIME}

- Review #{N} in the series
- {lines} lines added to permanent record

**Next Steps:**
{If changes applied}
- [ ] Review applied changes
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Commit changes

{If no changes}
- External review did not identify actionable issues
- See evaluation record for details

**Circular Review:**
- This evaluation is now part of the permanent record
- Future reviews will reference these decisions
- Consistency maintained across {N} total reviews
```

---

## Evaluation Principles

**I will ACCEPT suggestions when:**
- ✅ Real issue confirmed by inspecting actual code
- ✅ Violates documented project standards
- ✅ Breaks language/framework best practices
- ✅ Creates security vulnerability
- ✅ Causes actual bugs or errors
- ✅ Impacts business requirements

**I will REJECT suggestions when:**
- ❌ Issue doesn't exist in actual code
- ❌ It's an intentional project pattern
- ❌ External reviewer misunderstood architecture
- ❌ It's stylistic preference without substance
- ❌ Change would violate project standards
- ❌ Based on outdated information
- ❌ Would introduce new problems

**I will MODIFY suggestions when:**
- ⚠️ Issue is real BUT proposed fix is wrong/incomplete
- ⚠️ Better solution exists that aligns with project patterns
- ⚠️ Fix needed but different approach required
- ⚠️ Suggestion addresses symptom not root cause

**Critical Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Evidence-based** - Verify every claim against actual code
2. **Standards-aligned** - Match project conventions
3. **Context-aware** - Consider business requirements
4. **Risk-conscious** - Evaluate impact of changes
5. **Independently verified** - Don't trust, verify
6. **Historically consistent** - Align with past decisions

**Circular Review Principle:**
- We review external reviews (this workflow)
- We record our evaluations (Phase 7)
- We review our past evaluations (Phase 1)
- We improve our evaluation process over time
- We build institutional knowledge

**I am NOT:**
- ❌ A rubber stamp for external reviews
- ❌ Obligated to implement all suggestions
- ❌ Deferring to external authority without verification

**I AM:**
- ✅ An independent evaluator
- ✅ Responsible for code quality
- ✅ Guardian of project standards
- ✅ Final decision maker on changes
- ✅ Building learning feedback loop
