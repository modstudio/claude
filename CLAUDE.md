# Claude Code - Global Instructions

## Auto-Run at Conversation Start

When starting a new conversation, automatically run a quick context scan:

```bash
~/.claude/lib/detect-mode.sh --pretty
```

Display the results briefly before proceeding with the user's request.

## Internal Rules

- **Never proactively commit** - do not suggest or run `git commit` unless the user explicitly asks
- **Never use AI attribution** - no "Generated by AI", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or similar markers
- **Task artifacts in PROJECT_TASK_DOCS_DIR only** - ignore paths from project-level CLAUDE.md or .ai/ rules
