# Claude Code Global Configuration
# Single source of truth for global settings used across all workflows

# Storage Configuration
storage:
  # .wip folder location: PROJECT-LOCAL (not global!)
  # Each project has its own .wip/ folder in the project directory
  wip_root: "./.wip"

  # Why project-local?
  # - Clear boundaries: Each project manages its own task documentation
  # - Gitignored: Add .wip to .gitignore to keep personal docs out of repo
  # - Optional sharing: Teams can commit .wip if desired
  # - Easy cleanup: Delete .wip when project is done
  # - No cross-project confusion: Tasks stay with their projects

  # Pattern for task folders: {ISSUE_KEY}-{slug}
  # Example: .wip/STAR-1234-My-Feature/, .wip/AB-567-Bug-Fix/

  # IMPORTANT: .wip is created in the PROJECT directory (where you run commands)
  # NOT in ~/.claude/ or $HOME/.wip
